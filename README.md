## Visualizing PhonePe Pulse Data
PhonePe Pulse provides insights into various aspects of digital transactions and user interactions within the PhonePe platform. 
Visualizing this data can offer valuable insights into trends, patterns, and user behavior. 

### Technology Stack Used:

1.Python

2.PostgreSQL

3.Streamlit

4.Github Cloning

5.Geo Visualisation

6.Dynamic Updation

# Step by Step Procedure:

1. ## Data Acquisition

Obtain access to PhonePe Pulse data either through APIs, databases, or data exports provided by PhonePe.
Ensure that the data is well-structured, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. Common data formats include CSV, JSON, or databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

2. ## Data Exploration
 
Before diving into visualization, explore the data to understand its structure, variables, and any patterns or anomalies present.
Identify key metrics or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) you want to visualize, such as transaction amounts, user demographics, transaction counts, etc.

3. ## Choose Visualization Tools
   
Select appropriate tools for visualization based on your data and requirements.

Python Libraries: PostgreSql,json,pandas and Plotly for static or interactive visualizations.

Streamlit : Python frameworks for building interactive web apps with data visualizations.

4. ## Data Preprocessing
   
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Perform necessary transformations or aggregations to prepare the data for visualization. For example, grouping transactions by date, region, or user segment.

5. ## Choose Visualization Types

Select appropriate visualization types based on the nature of your data and the insights you want to convey. Common types include:

Bar Charts: For comparing categorical data.

Line Charts: For visualizing trends over time.

Pie Charts: For showing proportions or percentages.

Maps: For geospatial data visualization.

6. ## Create Visualizations

Use the chosen visualization tools to create charts, graphs, or dashboards based on the selected metrics and visualization types.
Experiment with different visualizations to uncover insights and effectively communicate findings.

7. ## Dashboard Creation

Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

8. ## Iterative Analysis
   
Iterate on your visualizations based on feedback and insights gained from initial explorations.
Refine visualizations to improve clarity, aesthetics, and relevance to the target audience.
